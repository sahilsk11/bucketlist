			<h1 class="text-center"> #5: DISRUPTING THE SMART-HOME</h1>
			<img src="5.png" class="title-img">

			<h3 class="theme-font">Description:</h3>
			<p class=" description">
				The smart-home field has grown incredibly over the past few years. New products are announced almost every month to connect every imaginable home appliance to the internet, from security cameras, stoves, and even refridgerators. Additionally, smart speakers such as Alexa, Google Home, and the Apple Homepod have revolutionized the way we interact with our homes. Nowadays, asking a computer to order you an Uber or turn on your TV has become ordinary to the tech world.
				<br>
				But the IoT and smart-home space have only just begun to scratch the surface of their potential.<br><br>
				Today, roughly 16% of Americans own a smart speaker according to a recent Tech Crunch, proving that today, IoT is still considered a luxury item for the tech-heads of the country. There is incredible room to expand into the market of lower cost products that can be marketed to the masses, and this is where I see the next IoT revolution.
				<br><br>
				In this bucket challenge, I want to search and develop the next generation of IoT products that are marketable to the masses - the devices that are affordable and practical to the next 50% of homeowners. In short, I believe that smart-home products have the ability to be as pervasive as smartphones are today, and I'm determined to bring about this change.

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHERE I AM NOW:</h5>
				<p class="description">
					I've been building prototypes for multiple smart-home devices, including StoveSensor, RainSensor, and even early versions of GarageSensor for my startup, IoT Space. This has given me a thorough understanding of where the smart-home market is today, and the current technologies that will drive it forward. This is the basic groundwork I will need to drive change in the market.
				</p>

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHAT'S LEFT:</h3>
				<p class="description">
					Next, I want to search for more commonplace household problems. Feedback I've received so far include less costly security systems, light systems, and even a general water-usage monitor. Additionally, over the next few weeks, I will be diving heavily into Alexa skills to learn how Alexa can be integrated with different devices around the home. I believe by first pursuing Alexa integration in devices and then addressing consumer needs in the market, I can begin building solutions that are available to all homeowners.
