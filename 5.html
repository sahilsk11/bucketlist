			<h3 class="theme-font">DESCRIPTION:</h5>
			<p class=" description">
				Forgetting to turn the stove off before your vacation. Leaving for work with the garage door open. Leaving sprinklers runnining in the rain. Based off of months of collecting data, these are the three most common household threats.
				<br>
				<br>
				It's these seemingly trifle issues that have the power to wreak incredible damage, but unfortunately, are simply too easy to forget. Especially in today's society where we are seemingly always on the move, these issues become exponentially more dangerous.
				<br><br>
				In this bucket challenge, I will search for ways to fix these three threats, and it seems the best way to do so is by building smart-home devices. This challenge is mostly complete as I have spent the last two years developing these devices, and two of them are already being sold for my startup, <a class="blue" target="_blank" href="http://www.iotspace.tech">IoT Space</a>.

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHERE I AM NOW:</h5>
				<p class="description">
					To solve the specific issues mentioned above, I have developed three devices: StoveSensor, RainSensor, and GarageSensor.
					<br><br>
					<a target="_blank" class="blue" href="http://www.iotspace.tech">StoveSensor is available for purchase today</a>, as I've spent the last year or so developing the device.
