			<h1 class="text-center"> #4: IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY (NAE CHALLENGE)</h1>
			<img src="4.png" class="title-img">

			<h3 class="theme-font">DESCRIPTION:</h5>
			<p class=" description">
				Securing cyberspace is arguably one of the most important yet challenging tasks facing 21st century engineers. In today's world, information such as credit cards, personal ID, and even confidential government files are stored on electronic mediums. Unfortunately, current protection procedures have proved unable to keep up with hackers.
				<br><br>
				From possible altering of the presidential election to thousands of identities stolen in the 2017 Equifax attack, cybersecurity threats have rapidly proliferated over the past few years, and the challenge presented here is a way to better protect electronic data.
				<br><br>
				Unfortunately, there will never be a "right answer" to solving cyber attacks. Many experts compare eradicating hacking to trying to hold water in a bucket with holes: it always finds a way around the barrier. Nevertheless, certain precautions, encryption protocols, and practices can mitigate hacking significantly, and the challenge presented here is searching for ways to do this.

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHERE I AM NOW:</h5>
				<p class="description">
					Over the past months, I have enrolled in multiple online cybersecurity courses to better understand practices used today and how/why they can fail. Surprisingly, I've found that most cyber attacks do not occur within large companies, but when users themselves leave their data open for theft (reusing passwords, typing personal data on malicious websites, and so on). In my mind, this changes the challenge quite a bit, as I'm now more interested in developing solutions to user's unsafe practices.

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHAT'S LEFT:</h3>
				<p class="description">My plan is to first build a solid foundation for current threats to cyberspace, and then to begin searching for possible solutions.</p>
