			<h1 class="text-center"> #2: IMPROVING THE RELIABILITY OF ALUMINUM-AIR BATTERIES</h1>
			<img src="2.png" class="title-img">

			<h3 class="theme-font">DESCRIPTION:</h5>
			<p class=" description">
				The aluminum-air battery is arguably the next “big thing” in all mobile device applications, from cell phones to laptops, and maybe even vehicles.
				<br><br>
				It’s no secret that the lithium-ion batteries used today are the limiting factor of almost all battery-powered devices. They are clunky, heavy, and in phones, they hardly last over a day. In cars, batteries must typically charge between 4-8 hours, then supply around 200 miles per charge. 
				<br><br>
				However, aluminum-air batteries can change all of that. In electric vehicles, it is estimated aluminum-air batteries can provide nearly 8 times the range of current batteries. In phones, these batteries can provide up to a week of use on a single charge. Finally, these batteries are significantly smaller and lighter than current options.
				<br><br>
				Unfortunately, the battery is not mainstream today due to numerous chemical faults, including the risk of aluminum corroding when exposed to air and water, and the fact that the aluminum anode must be replaced after every discharge. 
				<br><br>
				The challenge here is finding ways around the current shortfalls of aluminum-air batteries, whether that is testing the battery with different combinations of alloys to reduce the corrosion. Though this challenge blends into chemistry and physics, it still remains the key to a new world of engineering possibilities.

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHERE I AM NOW:</h5>
				<p class="description">
					I have completed research into how aluminum air batteries function and their benefits. In fact, I have written a <a class="blue" href="flexbattery.pdf" target="_blank">business report for a virtual company</a> that would produce these types of batteries.					
				</p>

			<h3 class="theme-font">WHAT'S LEFT:</h3>
				<p class="description">
					In high school, I have learned enough chemistry to understand the underlying effects of how an aluminum-air battery would function and how the chemical energy would discharge to produce electrical energy. The next stage will occur in my college chemistry class, where I look forward to discussing how to overcome the challenges associated with aluminum-air batteries.
